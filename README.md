## About

Air levitation is the process of lifting an object without mechanical support using an upward airflow to counteract gravitational force. This project implements a dynamic benchmark system that uses a ball and pipe setup controlled by an Arduino to achieve stable levitation.

## Installation

The following steps were used for the Air Levitation Control System:

1. Collect the hardware components:
   - DC 24V fan
   - Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
   - Arduino Uno
   - L298N DC motor driver

2. Assemble the prototype according to the provided schematic.

3. Connect the system identification toolbox to obtain the transfer function.

4. Implement the transfer function in your code to control the airflow and maintain the ball's position.

## Usage

Air levitation technology finds applications in various industries, offering advantages like minimal friction, precise positioning, and efficient load handling.
